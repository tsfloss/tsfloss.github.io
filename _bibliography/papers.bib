    abstract = "{Optimal extraction of cosmological information from observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) critically relies on our ability to accurately undo the distortions caused by weak gravitational lensing. In this work, we demonstrate the use of denoising diffusion models in performing Bayesian lensing reconstruction. We show that score-based generative models can produce accurate, uncorrelated samples from the CMB lensing convergence map posterior, given noisy CMB observations. To validate our approach, we compare the samples of our model to those obtained using established Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods, which assume a Gaussian lensing potential. We then go beyond this assumption of Gaussianity, and train and validate our model on non-Gaussian lensing data, obtained by ray-tracing N-body simulations. We demonstrate that in this case, samples from our model have accurate non-Gaussian statistics beyond the power spectrum. The method provides an avenue towards more efficient and accurate lensing reconstruction, which does not rely on an approximate analytical description of the posterior probability. The reconstructed lensing maps can be used as an unbiased tracer of the matter distribution, and to improve delensing of the CMB, resulting in more precise cosmological parameter inference.}",
