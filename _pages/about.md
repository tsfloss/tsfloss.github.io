I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. I will soon be joining the group of Oliver Hahn at the University of Vienna as a postdoc. I work primarily on the use of late time cosmological probes, such as galaxy surveys and intensity mapping (e.g. 21-cm) to study the primordial universe, in particular cosmic inflation and primordial non-Gaussianity. In my research I make use analytical as well as modern machine learning methods. Besides this, I like to think about formal aspects of cosmology such as consistency conditions and the cosmological bootstrap. Recently I have also been studying the amplitude double copy and its connection with massive gravity.

I have (co-)written several codes for cosmological data analysis. In particular, the jax-based code <a href='https://github.com/tsfloss/BFast'>BFast</a>  is able to rapidly evaluate the bispectrum of cosmological simulation boxes, using GPU acceleration. Together with Oliver Philcox, I co-wrote the <a href='https://github.com/oliverphilcox/PolyBin3D'>PolyBin3D</a> package, which allows for fast evaluation of polyspectra from surveys, including window deconvolution, also on GPU.

You can most easily access my work through my <a href='https://inspirehep.net/authors/2020981'>INSPIRE profile</a>.
