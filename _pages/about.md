I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. I will soon be joining the group of Oliver Hahn at the University of Vienna as a postdoc. I work primarily on the use of late time cosmological probes, such as galaxy surveys and intensity mapping (e.g. 21-cm) to study the primordial universe, in particular cosmic inflation and primordial non-Gaussianity. In my research I make use analytical as well as modern machine learning methods. Besides this, I like to think about formal aspects of cosmology such as consistency conditions and the cosmological bootstrap. Recently I have also been studying the amplitude double copy and its connection with massive gravity.

My PhD research is part of the  <a href='https://www.fundamentalsoftheuniverse.com'>Fundamentals of the Universe</a> program and my advisors are Dr. Daan Meerburg and Prof. Diederik Roest at the <a href='https://www.rug.nl/research/vsi/?lang=en'>Van Swinderen Institute for Particle Physics and Gravity</a> and Prof. LÃ©on Koopmans at the <a href='https://www.rug.nl/research/kapteyn/?lang=en'>Kapteyn Astronomical Institute</a>.
