I'm a postdoc at the University of Vienna in the computational cosmology <a href='https://cosmology.univie.ac.at'>group of Oliver Hahn</a>. I work primarily on the use of late time cosmological probes, such as galaxy surveys and intensity mapping (e.g. 21-cm) to study the primordial universe, in particular cosmic inflation and primordial non-Gaussianity. In my research I make use analytical, numerical and state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Currently, I am working on developing methods for field-level inference, as a means of optimal cosmological data analysis. I received my PhD from the University of Groningen, under the supervision of Daan Meerburg, Diederik Roest and Léon Koopmans.

I have (co-)written several codes for cosmological data analysis and forecasting. In particular, my JAX-based code <a href='https://github.com/tsfloss/BFast'>BFast</a>  is able to rapidly evaluate the bispectrum of cosmological simulation boxes, using GPU acceleration, and was used to rapidly compute the bispectrum of the 32,768 <a href='https://quijote-simulations.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bsq.html'>Quijote Big Sobol Sequence</a> simulations. Together with Oliver Philcox, I co-wrote the <a href='https://github.com/oliverphilcox/PolyBin3D'>PolyBin3D</a> package, which allows for fast evaluation of polyspectra from surveys, including survey window deconvolution, also on GPU.
